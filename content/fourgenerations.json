      "Charles Luck Jr., the founder of Luck Companies, was born in 18xx. In 1923, he founded Sunnyside Quarries, and in 1927, he separated the quarrying and construction businesses. Immediately faced with the Great Depression, he set up the Cook Car, an on-site kitchen to provide hot meals to associates each day, laying the groundwork for our company's deep commitment to people. With his leadership, the company not only survived this early test of resilience, but grew during this time, expanding to Charlottesville, Burkeville and Fairfax.",
      "Charles Luck Jr. was equal parts caring and visionary, combining his exceptional gift at building relationships with his keen intellect and sharp business acumen to build what has become the largest and fastest-growing family-owned aggregates company in the United States."

      "Charles “Charlie” Samuel Luck IV, President and CEO, is the third-generation leader of Luck Companies. In his youth, Charlie spent summers as a 12 year old sweeping shop floors, helping (and getting in the way) rebuilding engines and looking up to the men in the shop facility in Manakin Virginia. Traveling with his Dad to operations around the state solidified their relationship and ensured the philosophies of his father and grandfather (Pop Pop) were imbedded deeply within Charlie's head and heart. He formally joined the company in 1980 as a summer trainee, while attending Virginia Military Institute. After graduating in 1983 with a Civil Engineering degree, Charlie competed on the NASCAR circuit for four years before returning to the company. ",
      "Inspired by his father's and his grandfather's deep love for people, Charlie is responsible for establishing Luck Companies' Mission to Ignite Human Potential through Values-Based Leadership and positively impact the lives of others around the world. This philosophy has fueled two decades of significant and meaningful growth for people inside and outside of Luck Companies. Charlie is also the Founder of InnerWill, a nonprofit dedicated to Values-Based Leadership. ",
      "Under Charlie's leadership, the company has created six, five year strategic planning periods spanning from 2000 to 2025. These strategic planning windows have been instrumental in the growth and evolution of the company and recently culminated in expanding into new markets and communities within Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, with new locations across the Southeast, including the largest acquisition in company history.",
      "During his time as CEO, the company has been nationally recognized as a National leader for safety and environmental stewardship. The engagement and enablement of the associates has been recognized as being in the top 3 of companies around the World as a result of our 20 year focus on Igniting Human Potential through Values Based Leadership."
